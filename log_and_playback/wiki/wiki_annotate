# This will help us provide the reports required by the new laws:
# autonomous_regulation.pdf , section 227.46:
#
# (a) Upon receipt of a Manufacturer's Testing Permit, a manufacturer shall
#     commence retaining data related to the disengagement of the autonomous
#     mode. For the purposes of this section, "disengagement" means a
#     deactivation of the autonomous mode when a failure of the autonomous
#     technology is detected or when the safe operation of the vehicle requires
#     that the autonomous vehicle test driver disengage the autonomous mode and
#     take immediate manual control of the vehicle.
# (b) Every manufacturer authorized under this article to test autonomous
#     vehicles on public roads shall prepare and submit to the department an
#     annual report summarizing the information compiled pursuant to
#     subdivision (a) by January 1st, of each year.
#  (1) The first report shall cover the period from the date of issuance of the
#      Manufacturer's Testing Permit to November 30th of the following year.
#  (2) After the first report, subsequent annual reports shall cover the period
#      December 1st of the current year to November 30th of the following year.
#  (3) The annual report shall summarize disengagements for each month as
#      follows:
#   (A) The total number of autonomous mode disengagements and the
#       circumstances or testing conditions at the time of the disengagements
#       including:
#    (i)  The location: interstate, freeway, highway, rural road, street, or
#         parking facility.
#    (ii) A description of the facts causing the disengagements, including:
#         weather conditions, road surface conditions, construction,
#         emergencies, accidents or collisions, and whether the disengagement
#         was the result of a planned test of the autonomous technology.
#   (B) The total number of miles each autonomous vehicle tested in autonomous
#       mode on public roads each month.
#   (C) The period of time elapsed from when the autonomous vehicle test driver
#       was alerted of the technology failure and the driver assumed manual
#       control of the vehicle.
#  
# See: https://github.com/StanfordDrivingTeam/driving/issues/66
#
#
# This tool is limited to collecting data at the time of an incident
#  - there will be a separate tool to assemble the collected logs and
#    other data for annual reports to the DMV
# We need to collect:
#  - The location (a.3.A.i) - we can probably default this to "street"
#  - The "facts" (a.3.A.ii) - why the driver disengaged the system, planned or 
#                             unplanned
#  - Time between alert of failure and disengagement of system (a.3.C)
#
# Once we've extracted the relevant data from the log file, create a temporary
#  file and open $EDITOR (or gedit) so that the user can add notes
# When the user has saved the temporary file and closed the editor, append
#  the temporary file content to the relevant wiki page and commit it
